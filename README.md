# Drakpics

1. Upload your pictures.
2. Name them uniquely.
3. One uploaded click on the link and when the image displays right-click it and copy-address.
3a. You may also right-click the link without opening the image, select copy-address there as well.
4. Now you can paste this into the URL fields to display the image.

NOTE: Make sure the image is not too large, as the space is small.

Try to make the image from top view, or make sure thei mage is taller than it is wide, and mostly of the ship, with limited background around it. Again, the space is small.
